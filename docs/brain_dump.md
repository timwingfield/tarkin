# Brain Dump

## Component thoughts
Clock: One or two 7-segment displays. If one, then let it toggle between a counter and the time of day.

Weapons storage: A compartment with a lock (mechanical or magnetic) that will hold a nerf gun or two. Will need a code or control on the panel
to open.

Keypad: A standard 12 digit keypad somewhere on the panel.

Keyboard: Regular keyboard, maybe in a hidden area. Or can open and close it. Could also make it pluggable into a USB port that's exposed.

Power Slider: An analog lever that will control a power meter. Lever like the Death Star gunners pull, or Obi-Wan does in Ep IV to turn off the
tractor beam. The lights it controls will go higher or lower based on where the lever is.

Display: A small display for showing static images based on various settings on the control panel. Could be more, could be a touch screen, too.

Dial: Put a "clicky dial" on the panel to change where you are. Thoughts are Death Star, Star Destroyer, Rebel Ship, First Order Ship, Resistance
Ship, maybe a planet or two.

Speakers: Will need sound of some kind. Pew, Pew sounds, background music, spaceship sounds.

Fuse: Put a panel in with a fuse connection or two. Moving the fuse could change items to accept codes. Could change your "place" instead of the
clicky dial idea above. Could change what some controls do.
  - Fuse to accept codes: if the fuse is in position 1, then compartments and lights are controlled with switches. In position 2, the same items
  could be controlled by codes entered on the main keypad, or other keypads on the panel. Will need a way to set the codes, and a reset of some
  kind.
  - Fuse for places: Move a fuse between different ports to change your location. Might just be a way to change led colors on the panel.
  - The fuse idea is one that is interesting, and could be expanded to include sliding a whole "board" in place. Maybe "hot wiring" across ports,
  too. Maybe crossing ports initiates a "self destruct" with sounds, timers, and everything.

Switches: Set up switches to control LEDs, things on the display or displays, and locks and compartments.

Processors: Thinking this will be controlled by a RaspPi with various arduino boards as needed.
